**Subject:** Mathematics
**Class:** Grade 10
**Main Topic:** Basic Algebraic Concepts
**Sub-topic:** Variables and Constants

**Presenter's Introduction**
Welcome to our lesson on algebra! Algebra is everywhere in our daily lives - from calculating tips at restaurants to determining how much paint you need for your room.

**Lesson Outline**
- Definition: Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols and letters to represent numbers
- Variables: Letters that represent unknown numbers (like x, y, z)
- Constants: Fixed numbers that do not change
- Basic operations with variables

**Examples of Algebra in Everyday Life**
1. Shopping: If you buy 3 items at x dollars each, total cost = 3x
2. Age problems: If John is 5 years older than Mary (y), then John's age = y + 5
3. Speed calculations: Distance = Speed  Time (d = st)
4. Recipe scaling: Double a recipe means multiply each ingredient by 2

**Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)**
1. What is a variable in algebra?
   A) A fixed number  B) A letter representing an unknown  C) An operation
   Answer: B

2. In the expression 3x + 5, what is the constant?
   A) 3  B) x  C) 5
   Answer: C

**Closing**
Today we learned that algebra uses variables to represent unknown quantities, making it easier to solve real-world problems. Next lesson, we will explore solving simple equations.
